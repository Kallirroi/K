I am a proud alum from Interactive Things in Zurich, and I will start at the MIT Media Lab in September. </p><p>In my free time I run long distances, read, write, photograph and have espresso-fueled debates - often about politics.</p> <p>I like coffee, crispy bread and nice notebooks.</p> <p>I was born in Greece but have spent all my adult life in Switzerland and the USA.</p>',
